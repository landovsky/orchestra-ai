Views
- create ViewComponent's, inherit from BaseComponent
- load data in controllers
- render ViewComponent directly from controller actions (eg Customer::PageComponent.new) - don't use traditional views (eg show.html.erb)

Testing support
- decorate HTML elements with classes and ids that will make css selectors legible and easier to debug
