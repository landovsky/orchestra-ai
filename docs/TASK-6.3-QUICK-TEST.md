# Task 6.3: Quick Testing Guide

## Quick Console Test

Test the epic dashboard from Rails console:

```ruby
# 1. Ensure you have a user and repository
user = User.first || User.create!(email: 'test@example.com', password: 'password123')
repo = Repository.first || Repository.create!(
  user: user, 
  name: 'test-repo', 
  github_url: 'https://github.com/user/test-repo'
)

# 2. Create an epic with tasks
tasks = [
  "Task 1: Add user authentication",
  "Task 2: Create dashboard UI",
  "Task 3: Deploy to production"
]

result = Epics::CreateFromManualSpec.run!(
  user: user,
  repository: repo,
  tasks_json: tasks.to_json,
  base_branch: "main"
)

epic = result[:epic]
puts "âœ… Created Epic ##{epic.id}: #{epic.title}"
puts "   View at: http://localhost:3000/epics/#{epic.id}"

# 3. Simulate different task states for testing UI
task1, task2, task3 = epic.tasks.ordered

# Task 1: Running
task1.update!(
  status: :running,
  branch_name: "cursor-agent/task-1-abc123"
)

# Task 2: PR Open with link
task2.update!(
  status: :pr_open,
  pull_request_url: "https://github.com/user/repo/pull/123",
  branch_name: "cursor-agent/task-2-def456"
)

# Task 3: Keep as pending

puts "\nðŸ“‹ Task States:"
puts "   Task 1: #{task1.status} (#{task1.branch_name})"
puts "   Task 2: #{task2.status} (#{task2.pull_request_url})"
puts "   Task 3: #{task3.status}"

puts "\nâœ… Ready to test! Visit: http://localhost:3000/epics/#{epic.id}"
```

## Expected Dashboard Display

When you visit the epic page, you should see:

### Header Section
- **Epic Title**: e.g., "Epic #123: test-repo @ main"
- **Status Badge**: "Pending" (gray badge)
- **Repository**: "test-repo"
- **Base Branch**: "main"

### Tasks Section
Three task cards showing:

1. **Task #1**
   - Status: "Running" (yellow badge)
   - Description: "Task 1: Add user authentication"
   - Branch: `cursor-agent/task-1-abc123`

2. **Task #2**
   - Status: "Pr open" (purple badge)
   - Description: "Task 2: Create dashboard UI"
   - PR Link: "View Pull Request â†’" (clickable, opens in new tab)
   - Branch: `cursor-agent/task-2-def456`

3. **Task #3**
   - Status: "Pending" (gray badge)
   - Description: "Task 3: Deploy to production"

### Action Buttons
- **Start Epic** (disabled button with tooltip)
- **Refresh** (reloads the page)
- **Create Another Epic** (links to /epics/new)

## Testing Different Scenarios

### Test Epic in Different States

```ruby
# Test with running epic
epic.update!(status: :running)
# Refresh browser to see yellow "Running" badge on epic

# Test with completed epic
epic.update!(status: :completed)
# Refresh browser - Start Epic button should be hidden

# Reset to pending
epic.update!(status: :pending)
```

### Test All Task States

```ruby
epic.tasks.each_with_index do |task, i|
  status = [:pending, :running, :pr_open, :merging, :completed, :failed][i % 6]
  task.update!(status: status)
end
# Refresh browser to see all different badge colors
```

### Test Without PR Links

```ruby
epic.tasks.each { |t| t.update!(pull_request_url: nil) }
# Refresh browser - PR links should not appear
```

## Manual UI Verification Checklist

- [ ] Epic status badge shows with correct color
- [ ] Repository name is visible
- [ ] Base branch is visible

- [ ] All tasks are listed in order
- [ ] Task position numbers are correct (#1, #2, #3)
- [ ] Task status badges show with correct colors
- [ ] Task descriptions are readable
- [ ] PR links appear when URLs are present

- [ ] Refresh button is clickable
- [ ] Refresh button reloads the page

## Browser Test

```bash
# Start Rails server
bin/dev

# Visit in browser
# http://localhost:3000/epics/new
# 1. Create an epic with 3 tasks
# 2. Submit the form
# 3. You'll be redirected to the show page
# 4. Verify all elements appear correctly
# 5. Click Refresh - page should reload
# 6. Hover over Start Epic - tooltip should show

## Status Color Reference

| Status | Color | Badge Example |

## Troubleshooting

### Epic not found
- Make sure you created an epic first via console or /epics/new

### Tasks not showing
- Verify tasks were created: `epic.tasks.count`
- Check task descriptions are not nil: `epic.tasks.pluck(:description)`

### PR link not showing
- Verify `pull_request_url` is set: `task.pull_request_url`
- URL must be a valid HTTP/HTTPS URL

### Start Epic button not showing
- Button only shows for pending epics: `epic.pending?`
- Check epic status: `epic.status`

### Colors not showing
- Verify Tailwind CSS is compiled
- Check browser console for CSS errors
- Restart Rails server if needed

## Success Criteria

âœ… All elements display correctly
âœ… Status badges show correct colors
âœ… Manual refresh works
âœ… PR links are clickable
âœ… Start Epic button is visible but disabled
âœ… Layout is clean and responsive

Task 6.3 is complete when all checklist items pass!
