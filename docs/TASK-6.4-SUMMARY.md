# Task 6.4: Start Epic Button - Summary

## What Was Implemented

### Core Functionality
✅ **POST /epics/:id/start** route and controller action
✅ **Epics::Start** interaction class with validations
✅ **Updated UI** with functional "Start Epic" button
✅ **Comprehensive test suite** with 20+ test cases
✅ **Test script** for console validation

## Files Created/Modified

### Created Files:
1. `app/interactions/epics/start.rb` - Business logic for starting epics
2. `spec/interactions/epics/start_spec.rb` - Comprehensive test coverage
3. `script/test_start_epic.rb` - Console test script
4. `docs/TASK-6.4-COMPLETED.md` - Detailed documentation
5. `docs/TASK-6.4-SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Modified Files:
1. `config/routes.rb` - Added POST /epics/:id/start route
2. `app/controllers/epics_controller.rb` - Added start action
3. `app/views/epics/show.html.erb` - Enabled Start Epic button

## How It Works

1. **User clicks "Start Epic" button** (only visible for pending epics)
2. **POST request** sent to `/epics/:id/start`
3. **Controller** calls `Epics::Start.run(user:, epic:)`
4. **Interaction validates**:
   - Epic belongs to user
   - Epic is in pending status
   - Epic has cursor agent credential
   - Epic has at least one task
5. **On success**:
   - Epic status → 'running'
   - First task enqueued via `Tasks::ExecuteJob`
   - User redirected with success message
6. **On failure**:
   - User redirected with error message
   - No changes to database

## Key Features

- **Atomic transactions** ensure data consistency
- **Proper validations** prevent invalid state changes
- **User feedback** via flash messages
- **Job enqueueing** for async task execution
- **Only first task** is enqueued (sequential execution)

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ POST /epics/:id/start route created
✅ Route calls Epics::Start interaction
✅ Can start epic from browser
✅ Refresh page shows first task running
✅ Proper error handling and validation

## Testing

Run the spec:
```bash
bundle exec rspec spec/interactions/epics/start_spec.rb
```

Test from console:
```bash
rails console
load 'script/test_start_epic.rb'
```

## Next Phase

**Phase 7: Sequential Task Orchestration** - Implement automatic task chaining, PR merging, and epic completion logic.
