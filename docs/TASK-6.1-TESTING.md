# Task 6.1: Testing Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the tests written for Task 6.1 (EpicsController#new - Manual Spec Form).

## Tests Created

### 1. Controller Specs (`spec/controllers/epics_controller_spec.rb`)

**Location:** `/workspace/spec/controllers/epics_controller_spec.rb`

**Coverage:**
- ✅ `GET #new` action
  - Returns success status
  - Assigns a new Epic instance
  - Loads only current user's repositories
  - Renders the new template
  - Redirects unauthenticated users to sign in

- ✅ `GET #show` action
  - Returns success status
  - Assigns the correct epic
  - Preloads tasks association
  - Renders the show template
  - Prevents access to other users' epics (raises RecordNotFound)
  - Handles non-existent epics (raises RecordNotFound)
  - Redirects unauthenticated users to sign in

**Test Count:** 13 controller specs

### 2. Request/Feature Specs (`spec/requests/epics_spec.rb`)

**Location:** `/workspace/spec/requests/epics_spec.rb`

**Coverage:**

#### GET /epics/new (Smoke Tests)
- ✅ Page loads successfully
- ✅ Displays "Create New Epic" title
- ✅ Displays repository dropdown with label
- ✅ Shows user's repositories in dropdown
- ✅ Displays base branch input with default "main"
- ✅ Displays tasks textarea with placeholder
- ✅ Displays submit and cancel buttons
- ✅ Shows helper text for both fields
- ✅ Handles multiple repositories
- ✅ Handles users with no repositories

- ✅ Displays all tasks in order with positions (#1, #2, #3)
- ✅ Shows task statuses (pending, running, completed, etc.)
- ✅ Displays PR links for completed tasks
- ✅ Shows branch names when present
- ✅ Displays back and refresh buttons
- ✅ Handles different epic statuses (pending, running, completed, failed)
- ✅ Handles epics with no tasks
- ✅ Prevents access to other users' epics
- ✅ Redirects unauthenticated users

#### GET / (Root Path)
- ✅ Redirects to new epic page

**Test Count:** 35 request/feature specs

## Model Specs (Pre-existing)

The following model specs already existed and adequately cover the Epic and Task models:
- ✅ `spec/models/epic_spec.rb` - Comprehensive Epic model tests
- ✅ `spec/models/task_spec.rb` - Comprehensive Task model tests (including `pr_url` attribute)

No additional model tests were needed as the models were not changed in this task.

---

## Specification Updates

### Updated: `docs/spec-orchestrator.md`

**Change:** Updated Task model schema to reflect actual implementation

**Before:**
```
* pull_request_url
```

**After:**
```
* pr_url (shortened from pull_request_url for consistency)
```

**Justification:** The database schema uses `pr_url` (not `pull_request_url`) for brevity and consistency with Rails conventions. This naming was established in earlier phases (Tasks 4-5) and is consistently used throughout:
- Database column: `pr_url` 
- Model attribute: `task.pr_url`
- Webhook handler: saves to `pr_url`
- Views: references `task.pr_url`

The spec document has been updated to reflect this implementation reality with a note explaining the deviation.

---

## Test Patterns Used

All tests follow the existing patterns in the codebase:

1. **FactoryBot** for test data generation
2. **Shoulda Matchers** for model validations
3. **Request specs** instead of feature specs (Capybara not in Gemfile)
4. **Controller specs** for action-level testing
5. **Devise test helpers** for authentication (`sign_in`, `sign_out`)

---

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all specs
bundle exec rspec

# Run controller specs only
bundle exec rspec spec/controllers/epics_controller_spec.rb

# Run request specs only
bundle exec rspec spec/requests/epics_spec.rb

# Run with documentation format
bundle exec rspec spec/controllers/epics_controller_spec.rb --format documentation
```

## Test Coverage Summary

| Component | Test Type | Count | Status |
|-----------|-----------|-------|--------|
| EpicsController#new | Controller | 6 | ✅ |
| EpicsController#show | Controller | 7 | ✅ |
| GET /epics/new | Request | 12 | ✅ |
| GET /epics/:id | Request | 22 | ✅ |
| GET / (root) | Request | 1 | ✅ |
| **Total** | | **48** | ✅ |

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `spec/controllers/epics_controller_spec.rb`
- `spec/requests/epics_spec.rb`
- `docs/TASK-6.1-TESTING.md` (this file)

### Modified:

## Notes

- All tests follow Rails and RSpec best practices
- Tests are isolated and use database transactions
- Authentication is properly tested for all actions
- Authorization is tested (users can only access their own epics)
- Edge cases are covered (no repos, no tasks, non-existent records)
- All smoke tests verify page content and structure
- No linter errors in any test files
