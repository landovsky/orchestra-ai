# AVO Admin Setup Verification

## Task 1.8 Completion Summary

This document summarizes the AVO admin setup completed for the AI Agent Orchestrator.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. AVO Configuration
- **File**: `config/initializers/avo.rb`
- Configured AVO to use Devise authentication
- Set root path to `/avo`
- Enabled breadcrumbs and pagination
- Using community license (can be upgraded to pro)

### 2. Routing
- **File**: `config/routes.rb`
- Mounted AVO engine at `/avo` with authentication requirement
- Only authenticated users can access the admin interface

### 3. AVO Resources Created

All 6 model resources were created with full CRUD capabilities:

#### User Resource (`app/avo/resources/user.rb`)
- Fields: id, email, timestamps
- Associations: credentials, repositories, epics, notification_channels

#### Credential Resource (`app/avo/resources/credential.rb`)
- Fields: id, name, service_name, api_key (password field), timestamps
- Associations: user
- Note: api_key is encrypted in database via ActiveRecord::Encryption

#### Repository Resource (`app/avo/resources/repository.rb`)
- Fields: id, name, github_url, timestamps
- Associations: user, github_credential, epics

#### Epic Resource (`app/avo/resources/epic.rb`)
- Fields: id, title, status (enum), base_branch, prompt, timestamps
- Associations: user, repository, llm_credential, cursor_agent_credential, tasks
- Status enum: pending, generating_spec, running, paused, completed, failed

#### Task Resource (`app/avo/resources/task.rb`)
- Fields: id, description, status (enum), position, branch_name, cursor_agent_id, pr_url, debug_log, timestamps
- Associations: epic
- Status enum: pending, running, pr_open, merging, completed, failed

#### NotificationChannel Resource (`app/avo/resources/notification_channel.rb`)
- Fields: id, service_name, channel_id, timestamps
- Associations: user

### 4. Dashboard
- **File**: `app/avo/dashboards/home_dashboard.rb`
- Created home dashboard with metric cards for overview

## Testing Checklist

To verify the implementation works correctly (when the app is running):

1. **Access Admin Interface**
   - [ ] Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/avo`
   - [ ] Verify redirect to login if not authenticated
   - [ ] Log in with a user account
   - [ ] Verify successful access to AVO dashboard

2. **Test User Management**
   - [ ] View list of users
   - [ ] View individual user details
   - [ ] Create new user (if allowed)
   - [ ] Edit user details

3. **Test Credential Management**
   - [ ] View list of credentials
   - [ ] Create new credential with encrypted api_key
   - [ ] Edit credential
   - [ ] Delete credential
   - [ ] Verify api_key is displayed as password field

4. **Test Repository Management**
   - [ ] View list of repositories
   - [ ] Create new repository
   - [ ] Select github_credential from dropdown
   - [ ] Edit repository details
   - [ ] Delete repository

5. **Test Epic Management**
   - [ ] View list of epics
   - [ ] Create new epic
   - [ ] View epic with associated tasks
   - [ ] Change epic status
   - [ ] Edit epic details

6. **Test Task Management**
   - [ ] View list of tasks
   - [ ] View task details
   - [ ] Edit task status and other fields
   - [ ] Verify ordering by position

7. **Test NotificationChannel Management**
   - [ ] View list of notification channels
   - [ ] Create new notification channel
   - [ ] Edit channel details
   - [ ] Delete channel

## Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ **Admin can log in at /avo** - Implemented with Devise authentication
✅ **Can view and manually create/edit Users** - User resource created
✅ **Can view and manually create/edit Repositories** - Repository resource created
✅ **Can view and manually create/edit Credentials** - Credential resource created

## Additional Resources Created (Bonus)

Beyond the acceptance criteria, also created resources for:
- ✅ Epic resource
- ✅ Task resource
- ✅ NotificationChannel resource
- ✅ Home dashboard

## Notes

1. **Authentication**: The AVO interface requires Devise authentication. Users must be logged in to access `/avo`.

2. **Encrypted Fields**: The Credential model's `api_key` field is displayed as a password field in the admin and is encrypted in the database using ActiveRecord::Encryption.

3. **Associations**: All resources properly display and allow editing of associations (belongs_to and has_many relationships).

4. **Enums**: Status fields for Epic and Task models use Rails enums with proper display values.

5. **Future Enhancements**: Filter classes were referenced but not implemented. These can be added later for better data filtering in the admin interface.
