# Orchestra.ai - AI Agent Orchestrator
## Project Background & Product Description

### Vision Statement
Orchestra.ai is a revolutionary platform that orchestrates AI agents to execute complex software development tasks autonomously. By intelligently breaking down high-level requirements into sequential, manageable tasks and coordinating multiple AI agents, Orchestra.ai enables developers to focus on strategy while AI handles the implementation details.

### Problem Statement

#### The Current State of AI-Assisted Development
Today's AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, ChatGPT) excel at individual tasks but struggle with:
- **Context Loss**: Each interaction starts fresh, losing project context and architectural understanding
- **Task Fragmentation**: Complex features require multiple, disconnected AI interactions
- **No State Management**: AI can't track progress, handle dependencies, or maintain consistency across sessions
- **Manual Orchestration**: Developers must manually break down work, manage branches, and coordinate between different AI tools
- **Limited Integration**: AI tools operate in isolation without awareness of project structure, git workflows, or team processes

#### The Orchestration Gap
While individual AI agents are powerful, there's no system to:
- Decompose complex requirements into logical, sequential tasks
- Maintain context and state across multiple AI interactions
- Automatically manage git workflows, pull requests, and code reviews
- Provide real-time visibility into AI agent progress
- Handle errors, conflicts, and rollbacks intelligently
- Scale AI assistance to enterprise-level development workflows

### Solution Overview

Orchestra.ai fills this gap by providing an intelligent orchestration layer that:

1. **Intelligent Task Decomposition**: Uses LLMs to break complex requirements into sequential, atomic tasks
2. **Agent Coordination**: Manages multiple AI agents (Cursor, GitHub, etc.) with full context preservation
3. **Automated Workflow Management**: Handles git operations, PR creation, merging, and branch management
4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Provides live dashboards showing agent progress and task status
5. **Error Handling & Recovery**: Intelligently handles failures, conflicts, and rollbacks
6. **Enterprise Integration**: Supports team workflows, notifications, and multi-repository management
