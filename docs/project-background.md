# **Orchestra.ai: AI Agent Orchestrator**

### **The Problem**

AI coding assistants (like Cursor) are powerful but create a frustrating workflow:

1. **Awkward Wait Times:** Assistants take 30-60 seconds to complete a task. This is "dead time" for a developerâ€”too short to switch context, but long enough to break focus and flow.
2. **Poor Quality on Large Tasks:** To avoid the constant waiting, developers are tempted to give the AI large, complex tasks. The AI agents aren't good at this; they "create a mess" and produce low-quality code.
3. **Low AI Utilization:** Because the tool requires constant supervision, developers treat it as an "attended tool." This limits its use to maybe an hour a day, leaving a powerful resource sitting idle.

### **Our Solution**

Orchestra.ai transforms AI assistants from an **attended tool** into an **unattended workhorse**.

It's an orchestration layer that lets a developer assign large "Epics" (big assignments) and then walk away. Orchestra.ai intelligently breaks that Epic down into a sequence of smaller, well-defined tasks that AI agents *can* successfully execute.

It then runs that task sequence autonomously, handling the workflow from start to finish. It can manage multiple Epics at once, turning your AI assistant into a true automated team member.

### **Core Value**

* **For Developers:** Stop babysitting your AI. Give it a large "Epic" and get back 2-3 hours of *uninterrupted* focus time for architecture, code reviews, or strategic planning.
* **For Quality:** By breaking work into "right-sized" tasks, the AI produces higher-quality, more accurate code instead of a "mess."
* **For Utilization:** Orchestra.ai maximizes the time your AI is doing useful work. It turns an assistant you use for one hour a day into a workhorse that can run 8+ hours a day, completing work in the background.
